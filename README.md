# stockProfitCalculater

![alt text](img/image.png)

This project was created because, when a company transfers securities into personal accounts, the average cost on the account statements is recorded as 0, which distorts profit and loss figures. The project updates the average price of these transferred shares according to each company's own rules in order to accurately track gains and losses.

Additionally, implement an automatic periodic fixed-amount ordering feature and send email notifications to confirm whether orders were placed correctly.
